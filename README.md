Step 1: Install Python (if not already installed):

Open your web browser and search for "Python download."
Click on the official Python website link (python.org).
Download the latest version of Python for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Python.


Step 2: Save the script:

Copy the provided Python script and paste it into a text editor, such as Notepad or any code editor.
Save the file with a .py extension, for example, "typing_script.py".


Step 3: Install necessary libraries:

Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS/Linux).
Type the following command and press Enter to install the required libraries:
Copy code
**pip install pyautogui**


Step 4: Run the script:

Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS/Linux).
Navigate to the directory where you saved the Python script using the 'cd' command. For example:
bash
Copy code
cd C:\Users\91830\Desktop
Run the Python script by typing the following command and press Enter:
Copy code
python typing_script.py


Step 5: Switch to the text input field:

After running the script, quickly switch to the application or text input field where you want to type the content.


Step 6: Let the script do its work:

The script will wait for 5 seconds before starting to type the content.
Once the typing begins, it will type out the content character by character with a delay.


Step 7: Adjust the typing speed (optional):

If you find the typing speed too fast or slow, you can modify the 'typing_speed' variable in the script. A smaller value makes it slower, and a larger value makes it faster. For example, change the line:
makefile
Copy code
typing_speed = 0.01
to:
makefile
Copy code
typing_speed = 0.05
Please make sure to have the 'input.txt' file in the specified file path (C:\Users\91830\Desktop\input.txt) or modify the 'file_path' variable in the script to point to the correct location of your text file.

That's it! The script will type the content from the 'input.txt' file into the active text input field after 5 seconds.
